* Basic knowledge about crypto trading (bid/ask price, limit/market order)

Description

**Take your trading ideas to code and make them more efficient by automating them like a pro!**

This course will guide you through all the steps required to write a program in Python for algorithmic trading, using the best coding practices. It is a perfect example of the “learning by doing” pedagogy: instead of learning only theoretical concepts, you will learn important concepts whilst creating a *real trading application*, from API connections to trade management.

**Keep control over your trading robot with an interface**

A trading program can automate your strategy, but that’s not all: you can also use it as a trading assistant by building a user interface (UI) that will help you follow your trades and market data. This course will give you an understanding on how to develop a solid Tkinter interface and integrate it with the trading automation part.

**Interact with the crypto exchange servers without an intermediary**

Many platforms propose to write simplified code to automate your strategy and handle most of the interaction with an exchange API in the background. It doesn’t give you the freedom you may need, it prevents you from building very developed programs, and their service- of course- isn’t easy on the wallet.\
This course will teach you how to interact with an exchange API without an intermediary- giving you control of everything. It will also give you the power to improve your programming knowledge, which you can re-use for other projects.

**Learn with the Binance Futures and Bitmex APIs**

Binance and Bitmex are two of the most popular crypto exchanges in the world, they provide awesome automation possibilities and are great for beginners. You can then apply what you have learned to your **Binance Spot/Margin** account or **other exchanges**.

Both Binance and Bitmex have testing environments, including their API, which is a great way to learn!

## Who this course is for:

* Traders wishing to automate their strategies
* Python developers wanting an introduction to trading bots
* Developers wanting an introduction to GUI programming in Python
* Python beginners who want to learn about GUI programming and API connections with a real-world project
* Binance and Bitmex users who want to create their own trading tools
