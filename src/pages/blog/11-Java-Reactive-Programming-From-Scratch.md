**Description**

Learn Reactive Programming from scratch! With Assignments & Quizzes!

Reactive Programming is a programming style which deals with asynchronous data streams! A development model which focuses on observing data streams and reacting on changes and propagating them.

You learn Reactive Programming to build Reactive Systems – a highly resilient distributed systems or Microservices! Modern applications support huge number of concurrent users. Most of the applications are CRUD in nature with a lots of time consuming / blocking IO operations which is wasting the system resources. Reactive programming helps us to write highly resilient and reusable code in an asynchronous, non-blocking & declarative style. With less system resources, we get a lot more work done.
