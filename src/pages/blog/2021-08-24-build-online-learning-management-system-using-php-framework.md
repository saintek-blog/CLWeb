**Learning management system**

A learning management system (**LMS**) is a software application for the administration, documentation, tracking, reporting, automation and delivery of educational courses, training programs, or learning and development programs. The learning management system concept emerged directly from e-Learning

**Benefits of Learning Management System**

**1. Organizes eLearning content in one location.**\
Instead of having your eLearning content spread out over different hard drives and devices, you can store all of your eLearning materials in one location. This reduces the risk of losing important data and makes it easier to create your eLearning course. Every member of your eLearning team can also access the information if you’re using a **cloud-based Learning Management System**, thanks to the fact that it’s all stored on the remote server. This makes Learning Management Systems a natural fit for online collaboration.

**2. Provides unlimited access to eLearning materials.**\
Once you upload your eLearning course materials onto the LMS and publish them, your audience has unlimited access to the information they need. Even those who are on the go can login to the eLearning platform via their smartphones and tablets, so that they don’t have to wait until their next online training session to develop skills and perfect work-related tasks. This is one of the main reasons why a LMS is essential for global audiences in different time zones.

**3. Easily tracks learner progress and performance.**The best Learning Management System gives you the ability to keep track of learner progress and ensure that they are meeting their performance milestones.

**4. Reduces Learning and Development costs.**\
A Learning Management System gives you the power to completely do away with instructor travel costs, online training site rentals, and printed eLearning materials. Your online learners can carry out all of their training online, which means that you can save a sizable sum on your Learning and Development budget. For example, you won’t have to worry about printing out 500 manuals and booking a hotel room for your instructor, because all the information your online learners require is right in the LMS.

**5. Reduces Learning and Development time.**\
A Learning Management System can even reduce online training times, thanks to the fact that it gives online learners only the information they need in a direct and organized manner. Instead of having to sit through a lengthy half-hour online training course, online learners can simply click on the online modules they need and absorb the knowledge in a fraction of the time. **They can also assess their understanding by taking online exams** or quizzes, participate in interactive scenarios and simulations, and watch eLearning videos that highlight complex processes or tasks.

**6. Quickly and conveniently expands eLearning courses.**If you want to add additional online modules to your eLearning course in order to update information based on new trends or scientific evidence, you can simply login to the Learning Management System and make the necessary modifications without redoing your entire eLearning course. All of the content is in one location, which allows you to change only the master eLearning course and then deploy it to all of your online learners. This is in stark contrast to a traditional course, where you would have to send every member of your audience an updated manual or updated handouts.
