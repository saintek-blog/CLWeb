* Control the flow of code execution by using Conditional Statements (if/else, if/else if/else, switch)
* Work with the Console and Manipulate all of its aspects
* Effective ways to manipulate strings
* How to use loops in many different scenarios
* Work with One and Multi dimensional arrays

* Strong desire to learn, coding requires a lot of time to master it!

**Description**

In a digitalized world, such as the one we live in, not knowing how to code will put you at a disadvantage. Regardless of what your goal is, wether its to find a job as a developer or not, knowing a little bit of coding can be really handy from time to time.

And C# is a great language to start. Why? Well what I like the most about C# is its structure, its a strong typed language. What does that mean? It means that everything is “defined” in C#, which in turn lets you write beautiful code, you will see that at one point writing the code becomes an art, it just looks beautiful when you structure it the correct way.

Leave the aesthetics, with C# you can create anything, desktop application, websites, Android/iPhone applications, games, anything you can think of, you can create it with C#.

By learning to code with C# you will be able to jump quickly into any other language, if you need to at some point. The reason for that is, again, the strongly typed and well created hierarchy in C#, which will basicly teach you everything you need to know about coding in general.

All programming languages are pretty much the same, on the basic level the difference is only in the syntax. All of them have variables, loops, arrays etc., so if you think that you will need to jump to another language at some point, do not worry, you will be able to do that with ease. I myself started with C#, then I moved on to a little bit of Java, then a little JavaScript, then a little TypeScript, and if I didn’t have the solid foundations that I have with C#, it wouldn’t have been that easy!

This is why I am able to help you forge the most solid foundations that you may ever get in coding. Just like everything in life, your first exposure to something new is the most crucial one.

This course will teach you both the theory and the practice behind coding. You will learn by watching, by doing and mostly by struggling. 

You will also find numerous examples and projects to practice what we are learning and nothing will be left out. At the end of each section there will be a short quiz that will test you for some of the tricky parts of that section.


**Who this course is for:**

* This course is for anyone who wants to learn how to code, no previous experience is required
* Students looking for a C# course to refresh their knowledge
