**Description**

In this course you learn how to develop android + iOS augmented reality face filters app like Snapchat Filters.

Augmented reality is an interactive experience of a real-world environment where the objects that reside in the real world are enhanced by computer-generated perceptual information, sometimes across multiple sensory modalities, including visual, auditory, haptic, somatosensory and olfactory. Augmented reality (AR) is one of the biggest technology trends of 2017, and it’s only going to get bigger as AR ready smartphones and other devices.

The Augmented reality is additive, overlaying digital content onto the real world. The user is aware of and can still interact with his environment. Designers of AR software and apps will find many of the traditional tools still very useful: e.g., paper and video prototyping, understanding existing mental models, etc. So in this course, both android + iOS app we will develop using Flutter with the concepts of DeepAR ai. he DeepAR Augmented Reality SDK and platform detects faces and facial features, using a variety of proprietary data models, and also advanced machine learning in 3D. It has extremely fast and precise face detection, fast and robust eye, nose and chin detection. It detects more than 68 facial feature points at up to 60 frames per second.  DeepAR is optimised to detect multiple faces in realtime, specifically on mobile devices. The DeepAR Augmented Reality SDK is made for developers who want to add the highest quality, mobile optimised, Snapchat and Facebook style 3D and realistic face lenses, masks and special FX to iOS and Android applications. The best part is that the DeepAR SDK can be integrated in a matter of minutes, and supports hundreds of masks, lenses, effects, and filters. Our team is also ready to help you create amazing new content for your platform. The DeepAR Augmented Reality platform also includes robust, realtime face and head-tracking. DeepAR can track any face under almost light conditions from any angle, even when the head is turned 180 degrees either side. ​ DeepAR can track multiple faces in realtime with high performance, and is optimised for lower end smartphones.

**Who this course is for:**

* Anyone with basic flutter knowledge.
* Anyone with basic Dart Programming Language knowledge.
